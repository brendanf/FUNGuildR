Title: Look Up Guild Information for Fungi and Nematodes
Version: 0.1.0.9999
Author: Brendan Furneaux, Zewei Song (Python version)
Maintainer: Brendan Furneaux <brendan.furneaux@gmail.com>
Description: This is a simple reimplementation of FUNGuild_v1.1.py. It queries
    the FUNGuild or NEMAGuild databases (http://www.stbates.org/guilds/app.php)
    and assigns trait information based on matching to a taxonomic
    classification. It does not include a copy of the FUNGuild or NEMAGuild
    databases, because they are continually updated as new information is
    submitted, but it does have methods to download them and store them as R
    objects to speed up repeated queries or to allow local queries without
    internet access.
