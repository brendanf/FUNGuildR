Description: A tool for assigning trait information based on matching to a
  taxonomic classification, using the FUNGuild database (Nguyen et al. 2016;
  <doi:10.1016/j.funeco.2015.06.006>). In normal use, the database is queried
  for each function call, because FUNGuild is continually updated as new
  information is submitted. However, FUNGuildR also includes functions to
  download the database and store it as an R object to speed up repeated
  queries, make queries reproducible over time, and allow local queries without
  internet access.
